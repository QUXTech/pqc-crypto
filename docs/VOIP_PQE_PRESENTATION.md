# QuxTech Quantum-Safe VoIP Security

## Protecting Your Voice Communications for the Post-Quantum Era

---

# The Challenge

## Today's Encryption Won't Protect Tomorrow's Calls

Current voice communication systems rely on encryption methods developed decades ago. While secure against today's computers, these methods face an existential threat:

**Quantum computers will break traditional encryption.**

This isn't a distant future problem—it's happening now:

- Nation-states are stockpiling encrypted communications today
- When quantum computers mature, historical intercepts become readable
- Voice calls containing sensitive business, legal, or personal information are at risk
- The threat model has shifted from "break now" to "harvest now, decrypt later"

# The Stakes

## What's at Risk?

| Sector | Vulnerable Communications |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Financial Services** | Trading instructions, M&A discussions, client advisory calls |
| **Healthcare** | Patient consultations, diagnostic discussions, treatment plans |
| **Legal** | Attorney-client privileged communications, case strategy |
| **Government** | Classified briefings, diplomatic communications |
| **Enterprise** | Board calls, strategic planning, intellectual property discussions |
| **Defense** | Tactical communications, intelligence briefings |

**The sensitive call you make today could be decrypted and exposed in 5-10 years.**

# The Solution

## QuxTech Quantum-Safe VoIP Encryption

QuxTech has developed a next-generation voice encryption system that protects communications against both current and future threats—including attacks from quantum computers.

### Built on NIST-Approved Standards

Our solution implements cryptographic algorithms selected and standardized by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) after an 8-year global competition:

- **FIPS 203** — Quantum-resistant key establishment
- **FIPS 204** — Quantum-resistant digital signatures

These standards represent the global consensus on post-quantum security.

# How It Protects You

## Defense in Depth

### Before the Call Connects

Every call begins with a secure handshake that establishes encryption keys immune to quantum attack. Even if an adversary records this exchange, future quantum computers cannot recover the keys.

### During the Call

Voice data is encrypted in real-time using military-grade symmetric encryption. Each audio frame receives individual protection with unique cryptographic material.

### After the Call Ends

Encryption keys are securely destroyed. There is no "master key" that could later be compromised. Each call's security is mathematically independent.

# Key Capabilities

## What QuxTech PQE VoIP Delivers

### Quantum-Resistant Key Exchange
Establishes shared secrets that cannot be broken by quantum computers, ensuring long-term confidentiality of your communications.

### Perfect Forward Secrecy
Each call uses unique, ephemeral keys. Compromise of one call does not affect any other—past or future.

### Real-Time Frame Encryption
Sub-millisecond encryption latency ensures call quality is never compromised. Security doesn't mean sacrificing clarity.

### Cryptographic Authentication
Both parties are verified using quantum-safe signatures, preventing impersonation and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Tamper Detection
Any attempt to modify voice data in transit is immediately detected, ensuring integrity of communications.

# Security Levels

## Choose Your Protection Level

QuxTech PQE VoIP offers two security tiers to match your requirements:

| Level | Protection Equivalent | Recommended For |
|-------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Level 3** | AES-192 | Standard enterprise communications, general business use |
| **Level 5** | AES-256 | Highly sensitive communications, regulated industries, government |

Both levels provide quantum resistance. Level 5 offers additional security margin for the most critical use cases.
