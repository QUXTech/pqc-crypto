# The Quantum Threat is Real

**"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later"** — Nation-states and sophisticated adversaries are recording encrypted communications today, waiting for quantum computers to break the encryption tomorrow.

**Your voice communications made today could be exposed in 5-10 years.**

Only post-quantum cryptography protects against this threat. QuxTech PQE VoIP is the first NIST-compliant quantum-safe voice encryption solution.

## The Quantum-Safe Gap

### Why Traditional Encryption Falls Short

| Encryption Method | Used By | Vulnerable To |
|-------------------|---------|---------------|
| RSA-2048 | Most VoIP signaling | Shor's Algorithm (Quantum) |
| ECDH P-256 | TLS key exchange | Shor's Algorithm (Quantum) |
| ECDSA | Digital signatures | Shor's Algorithm (Quantum) |
| AES-256 | Voice payload | Grover's Algorithm (Reduced security) |

### QuxTech's Quantum-Safe Stack

| Layer | QuxTech Technology | Protection Level |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Key Exchange | ML-KEM (FIPS 203) | Quantum-Resistant |
| Authentication | ML-DSA (FIPS 204) | Quantum-Resistant |
| Voice Encryption | AES-256-GCM | Quantum-Resistant* |
| Key Derivation | HKDF-SHA3 | Quantum-Resistant |

*AES-256 with 256-bit keys maintains 128-bit security against Grover's algorithm—still considered secure.

# Why Pay More for Quantum-Safe?

## The Cost of NOT Being Protected

| Risk Scenario | Potential Impact |
|---------------|------------------|
| M&A discussion intercepted, decrypted in 2030 | Insider trading liability, deal collapse |
| Attorney-client calls exposed | Malpractice, privilege waiver, sanctions |
| Patient health discussions leaked | HIPAA fines up to $1.5M per incident |
| Board strategy calls compromised | Competitive disadvantage, stock manipulation |
| Government classified calls decrypted | National security breach |

**The premium for quantum-safe encryption is insignificant compared to the cost of a breach.**

## Return on Investment

| Factor | Traditional VoIP | QuxTech PQE VoIP |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Monthly cost (100 users, Enterprise) | ~$3,500 | $4,950 |
| Additional cost | — | +$1,450/month |
| Annual premium | — | $17,400 |
| **Protection lifespan** | **5-7 years** | **25+ years** |
| Post-quantum upgrade cost later | $50K-500K+ | $0 (included) |

**Investing $17,400/year now avoids a potential six-figure migration and protects all communications retroactively.**
